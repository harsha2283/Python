#static arrays are something that can be modified but cannot be variable in the size. so python come up with dynamic arrays which we call as lists.

#list can be modified as follows appened,pop, insert,delete etc;

my_list= [1,2,3,4,5]

my_list.insert(2,10)

my_list.append(20)

my_list.pop(1)

my_list.remove(4)
print(my_list)


my_string = "DSA learning"

new_string = my_string+"s"

print(new_string)
