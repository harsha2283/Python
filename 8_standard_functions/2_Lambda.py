# To become an expert in lambda functions, let's cover some advanced topics and edge cases.

# Lambda Functions with Multiple Arguments

# Lambda functions can take multiple arguments by separating them with commas.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# add = lambda x, y: x + y
# print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
# In this example, the lambda function takes two arguments x and y and returns their sum.

# Lambda Functions with Default Arguments

# Lambda functions can have default arguments, just like regular functions.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# greet = lambda name = 'World': f'Hello, {name}!'
# print(greet())  # Output: Hello, World!
# print(greet('Alice'))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
# In this example, the lambda function has a default argument name set to 'World'. If no argument is provided, it defaults to 'World'.

# Lambda Functions with Variable Argument Lists

# Lambda functions can use the *args syntax to accept a variable number of arguments.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# sum_numbers = lambda *args: sum(args)
# print(sum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # Output: 15
# In this example, the lambda function takes a variable number of arguments and returns their sum.

# Lambda Functions with Keyword Arguments

# Lambda functions can use the **kwargs syntax to accept a variable number of keyword arguments.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# greet = lambda **kwargs: f'Hello, {kwargs["name"]}!'
# print(greet(name='Alice'))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
# In this example, the lambda function takes a variable number of keyword arguments and returns a greeting message.

# Lambda Functions with return Statements

# Lambda functions can use the return statement to specify a return value.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# is_even = lambda x: return x % 2 == 0
# print(is_even(4))  # Output: True
# Note that in Python 3, the return statement is not necessary in lambda functions, as the expression is evaluated and returned automatically.

# Lambda Functions with if-else Statements

# Lambda functions can use if-else statements to control the flow of the function.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# is_positive = lambda x: 'Positive' if x > 0 else 'Negative'
# print(is_positive(5))  # Output: Positive
# print(is_positive(-3))  # Output: Negative
# In this example, the lambda function uses an if-else statement to determine whether the input is positive or negative.

# Lambda Functions with try-except Blocks

# Lambda functions can use try-except blocks to handle exceptions.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# divide = lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else 'Error: Division by zero!'
# print(divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
# print(divide(10, 0))  # Output: Error: Division by zero!
# In this example, the lambda function uses a try-except block to handle the case where the denominator is zero.

# These are just a few more examples of the advanced topics and edge cases you can explore with lambda functions. Do you have any specific questions about these topics?

# Here are some more complex examples of lambda functions:

# Lambda Functions with Nested Functions

# Lambda functions can be used to define nested functions.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# outer = lambda x: (lambda y: y * x)(x * 2)
# print(outer(5))  # Output: 50
# In this example, the lambda function defines a nested function that takes an argument y and returns y * x. The outer function takes an argument x and returns the result of the nested function with x * 2 as the argument.

# Lambda Functions with Recursion

# Lambda functions can be used to define recursive functions.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# factorial = lambda n: 1 if n == 0 else n * factorial(n - 1)
# print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
# In this example, the lambda function defines a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number. The function calls itself with the argument n - 1 until it reaches the base case n == 0.

# Lambda Functions with Memoization

# Lambda functions can be used to implement memoization, a technique for optimizing recursive functions by storing the results of expensive function calls.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# memo = {}
# fib = lambda n: memo[n] if n in memo else (memo[n] := fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))
# print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
# In this example, the lambda function defines a recursive function that calculates the Fibonacci number of a given index. The function uses a dictionary memo to store the results of previous function calls, avoiding redundant calculations.

# Lambda Functions with Higher-Order Functions

# Lambda functions can be used to define higher-order functions, functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# double = lambda x: x * 2
# triple = lambda x: x * 3
# adder = lambda f, x: f(x)
# print(adder(double, 5))  # Output: 10
# print(adder(triple, 5))  # Output: 15
# In this example, the lambda function defines two higher-order functions double and triple that take an argument x and return its double or triple, respectively. The function adder takes a function f and an argument x and returns the result of applying f to x.

# Lambda Functions with Closures

# Lambda functions can be used to define closures, functions that have access to their own scope and can capture variables from that scope.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# outer = lambda x: (lambda y: y * x)(x)
# print(outer(5)(3))  # Output: 15
# In this example, the lambda function defines a closure that takes an argument x and returns a function that takes an argument y and returns y * x. The closure captures the variable x from its own scope and uses it to calculate the product.

# These are just a few more examples of the complex topics you can explore with lambda functions. Do you have any specific questions about these topics?

# The examples I provided earlier are relatively advanced, but there are even more complex and esoteric uses of lambda functions.

# Lambda Functions with Metaprogramming

# Lambda functions can be used to implement metaprogramming, a technique for writing code that generates or manipulates other code.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# meta = lambda f, args: (lambda *x: f(*x))(args)
# print(meta(lambda x, y: x + y, 2, 3))  # Output: 5
# In this example, the lambda function defines a metaprogram that takes a function f and its arguments args and returns a new function that applies f to args.

# Lambda Functions with Reflection

# Lambda functions can be used to implement reflection, a technique for inspecting and manipulating the structure of code at runtime.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# reflect = lambda f: (lambda *args: f(*args))(*f.__code__.co_argcount)
# print(reflect(lambda x, y: x + y))  # Output: 2
# In this example, the lambda function defines a reflection function that takes a function f and returns a new function that applies f to its arguments. The function uses the __code__ attribute of the function to inspect its argument count.

# Lambda Functions with Type Hierarchy

# Lambda functions can be used to implement type hierarchies, a technique for defining a set of related types and operations on those types.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# class Animal:
#     pass

# class Mammal(Animal):
#     pass

# class Dog(Mammal):
#     pass

# animal = lambda x: (lambda y: y if isinstance(y, x) else None)(x)
# print(animal(Dog()))  # Output: <__main__.Dog object at 0x...>
# In this example, the lambda function defines a type hierarchy of animals, mammals, and dogs. The function uses the isinstance function to check if an object is an instance of a particular type.

# Lambda Functions with Category Theory

# Lambda functions can be used to implement concepts from category theory, a branch of mathematics that studies the commonalities between different mathematical structures.

# Example:

# python

# Copy code
# functor = lambda f, x: (lambda y: y if f(y) == x else None)(x)
# print(functor(lambda y: y + 1, 5))  # Output: 6
# In this example, the lambda function defines a functor, a mathematical structure that maps objects from one category to objects in another category. The function uses the lambda function to define a mapping from one object to another.

# These examples are even more complex and esoteric than the previous ones, and they demonstrate the full range of possibilities for using lambda functions in advanced programming tasks.
